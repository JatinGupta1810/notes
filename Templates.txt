I had been working with a great team in my company and learned a lot, and I want to learn more complex technology, which my organization is unable to provide.











Managerial round:

Can you please talk about your strength and weaknesses?
My strength is that I love to learn new skills, to be self-motivated and flexible, and to work with team members so I can learn their approaches to solving any complex problem.

I can't say no, concentrate only on one thing at a time. When I get stuck with any problem, I think about it to find solutions.



Why Looking For a Job Change?

I have learned a lot from my current company, but my current job no longer provides the challenges and opportunities for growth that I seek.
I am looking for a role where I can continue to expand my skills, take on new responsibilities, and make a meaningful contribution.
